# Project Name: SnapChef

NOTE this is a work in progress. Integration of recipies are still in progress.

## Overview:
SnapChef is an innovative mobile application that provides users with personalized recipe suggestions based on food images. Using **React Native Vision**, the app leverages advanced image recognition technology to identify ingredients in a photo and then suggests a variety of relevant recipes that the user can try. Whether it's a snapshot of a dish, a picture of ingredients on the counter, or even a restaurant meal, SnapChef provides creative cooking ideas and recipe guidance.

## Key Features:

1. **Image Recognition with React Native Vision:**
